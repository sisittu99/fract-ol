# 42-Tutorial: Fract-ol

# The Subject

This project allows you to:
* ðŸŽ¨ learn how to use the MiniLibX library, a set of graphical functions very simple to use and unfortunately very little optimized in the compilation and execution;
* ðŸ§® review (I assume you've already dealt with them during high school or college) the set of *complex numbers* and their functioning, feeling firsthand their effective use;
* ðŸŒ¿ study the wonderfully fantastic world of **fractals**, whose definition [according to Wikipedia Italy](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frattale) (english version [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)) is
> "a geometric object endowed with internal homothety: **repeats itself in its form in the same way on different scales**, and therefore by zooming any of its parts, a figure similar to the original is obtained.
> 
> [...]
> 
> It comes from the Latin **fractus** *(broken)*, as well as the term fraction; in fact, fractal images are considered by mathematics to be *objects of non-integer dimension*."

It will be particularly tiring for me to write a purely theoretical tutorial on fractals, so I can't help but send you explanatory videos that allow you to understand what we are really talking about. The One Brown Three Blue YT channel is very useful in this regard: for years it has helped students and amateurs to visualize complex mathematical concepts in a simple way.
So, go from here! We'll meet again as soon as you get a clearer idea.

You won't really need them in writing the code, but it is an important concept and you'll have to implement the possibility to switch from Mandelbrot to Julia, which is its primitive of course.)
